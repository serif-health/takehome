# Serif Health Takehome Interviews

This repository contains the files and instructions for our takehome engineering interviews. Please *locally* copy the takehome specific to the role you're applying for to your own public repo or [import](https://github.com/new/import) to your github account for use in sharing solutions back to us. Direct public forks and pull requests will expose your identity and solution to other candidates also working on this interview question, and we want the interview process to be fair for everyone.
