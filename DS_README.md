# Data Scientist Take-Home Assignment

Welcome to the Data Scientist take-home assignment. This exercise is designed to assess your ability to integrate and harmonize disparate data sources into a unified schema. 

## Objective

Your task is to combine two distinct data samples consisting of three hospitals' pricing data for ten distinct medical billing codes. One sample came from the Transparency in Coverage data, the other from the Hospital Price Transparency files for those specific hospitals. The objective is to combine both into a cohesive and unified schema. This will involve:

- **Data Understanding**: Analyzing the structure and content of each data sample.
- **Data Integration**: Merging the data samples into a single, unified schema.
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the combined data.
- **Documentation**: Providing clear documentation of your approach and any assumptions made.

## Data Samples

You have been provided with two data samples:

1. **Payer Data Sample**: [https://mrf.serifhealth.com/public/payer_extract_202502.csv]
2. **Hospital Data Sample**: [https://mrf.serifhealth.com/public/hospital_extract_202502.csv]

Each data sample may have its own unique structure, format, and content. Your goal is to analyze these samples and determine the best approach to integrate them into a unified schema.

## Requirements

- **Programming Language**: Use Python for this assignment.
- **Libraries**: You may use any standard Python libraries or frameworks that you deem appropriate.
- **Output**: A unified dataset resulting from the integration of the two data samples, as well as any Python scripts, SQL, notebooks, or code extracts you use to get the job done.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive explanation of your approach, including any assumptions, methodologies, and decisions made during the process.
- **Time Investment**:We are a small engineering team with limited resources, and often have to make hard tradeoffs to meet deadlines and make rapid forward progress. We do not want this takehome to take more than a few hours out of your day. So, please timebox any solution to two hours max, and know that you have the opportunity to discuss the tradeoffs you made when submitting your solution. Experienced healthcare data folks should be able to draft a solution in ~2 hours. If you think this will take you dramatically more time than that, let us know before starting the takehome so we can discuss why. If you finish early, we'd recommend adding additional notes or commentary to the README (e.g. discussion of performance characteristics, how you would ideally test and release this in a production environment, feature iterations that might come next, so on), but please don't exceed the timebox doing so.
 
## Submission Guidelines
1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Please locally copy to your own public repo or import to your github account for use in sharing solutions back to us. Direct public forks and pull requests will expose your identity and solution to other candidates also working on this interview question, and we want the interview process to be fair for everyone.

3. **README File**:
   - Provide a `README.md` file at the root of your repository.
   - The README should include:
     - An overview of your approach.
     - Instructions on how to run your code.
     - Any other relevant information that would help in understanding and evaluating your work.

4. **Submission**:
   - Once you have completed the assignment, share the link to your repository with us for evaluation, by email us at engineering@serifhealth.com[mailto:engineering@serifhealth.com]

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Correctness**: The degree to which your unified dataset accurately represents the integration of the two data samples. There is no perfect answer, and there are some very hard subproblems that may not be solvable in a couple hours - that's ok. Just document those as todo's for future.
- **Code Quality**: Clarity, organization, and efficiency of your code.
- **Documentation**: Completeness and clarity of your documentation, including the README file.
- **Assumptions and Decisions**: Justification and reasoning behind any assumptions or decisions made during the integration process.

We look forward to reviewing your submission! If you have any questions or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Good luck!
